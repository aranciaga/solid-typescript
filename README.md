# Solid principles
Solid principles applied on Typescript

#### 1. Single responsibility principle: 
A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)

#### 2. Open/closed principle
“Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

#### 3. Liskov substitution principle
“Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.”
	
#### 4. Interface segregation principle
“Mny client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”
	
#### 5. Dependency inversion principle
One should “depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.”
